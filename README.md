## Overview

### The challenge

This challenge was to make a portfolio website with a minimalist design. Currently using React, NextJs and Css Modules for styling. I used a Mobile first approach for a responsive site.

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Tailwind
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

NextJs will actually optimize your images for you with their Image component which uses browser native lazy loading.

The Image component will optimize images based on screen sizes as well!

### Continued development

### Useful resources

-   [Hamburger Menu Research](https://ibaslogic.com/how-to-add-hamburger-menu-in-react/) - A good overview how to go about implementing a hamburger menu in react.

-   [Importing Fonts for NextJs](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/font) - NextJs docs on next/font and how to apply custom fonts to your documents.

-   [Netflify Page Deployment](https://www.netlify.com/) - I use Netlify for deploment because I found github pages can sometimes be buggy.
